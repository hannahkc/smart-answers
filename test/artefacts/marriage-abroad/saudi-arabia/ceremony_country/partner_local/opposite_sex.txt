Marriage in Saudi Arabia

One of you must be a Muslim to get married under local laws in Saudi Arabia. Contact the [Embassy of Saudi Arabia](http://www.saudiembassy.org.uk/) to find out about local marriage laws.

##Getting married at the British Embassy

^ You can only apply to get married at the British Embassy in Riyadh if you’re resident in Saudi Arabia and neither of you is a Muslim.^

[Book an appointment at the British Embassy in Riyadh.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-riyadh/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide:

- proof that you’ve been living in the country where you intend to get married for at least 21 days, e.g. an employer’s letter or a bank statement (you’ll also need to sign a declaration to confirm this)
- your original passport and [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof that you’re both over the age of 16, not within prohibited degrees of relationship to each other, and there’s no other impediment to your proposed marriage
- equivalent document for your partner

If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order), or
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

###What happens next

Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the embassy or consulate will post your marriage notice publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the consular officer can then perform the marriage ceremony any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.

You’ll need to pay additional fees for the marriage ceremony and to get your marriage certificate (see below).

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

## Fees
