Same-sex marriage and civil partnership in Vietnam

You may be able to register a civil partnership or get married at the British embassy or consulate in Vietnam.

Email <notarialservices.hanoi@fco.gov.uk> to make an appointment at the embassy in Hanoi.

^You must stay in Vietnam for 14 days from the date of your appointment, if you’re not normally resident in Vietnam.^

The embassy will confirm if your marriage can be registered and give you a link to book a ‘notice of marriage’ appointment online and a reference number. You must quote the reference number when booking your appointment.

You and your partner will need to sign a declaration and provide proof of residence eg, an employer’s letter, a bank statement or your Vietnamese visa.

You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

You’ll need to get the documents [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if they’re not in English and and [‘legalised’](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in your home country or your country’s embassy in Vietnam.

##What you need to do

You’ll need to be in Vietnam for 7 clear days (not including the date of arrival) before your appointment. At your appointment, the embassy or consulate will give you:

-  a notice of registration
-  a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership

Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

^You must stay in Vietnam while your notice is posted.^

As long as nobody registers an objection you can get married or enter into a civil partnership up to 3 months after you gave notice.

You’ll need to bring two witnesses to your ceremony - they’ll need to show their photo ID (for example passport or driver’s licence).

You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage or civil partnership and a fee for your marriage or civil partnership certificate.

^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
