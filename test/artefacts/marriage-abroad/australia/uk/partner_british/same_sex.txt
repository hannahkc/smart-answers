Same-sex marriage in Australia

You may be able to get married at the British High Commission or a British consulate in Australia.

Before you can get married you need to give notice of your intention to marry.

You and your partner must have lived in Australia for at least 7 full days before you give notice.

If you and your partner don’t normally live in Australia, there must be 14 full days between the date you give notice and the date you marry. You need to stay in Australia for the 14 days.

Book an appointment to give notice at:

* [the British Consulate Brisbane](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-brisbane/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)
* [the British High Commission in Canberra](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-high-commission-canberra/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)
* [the British Consulate General in Sydney](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-general-sydney/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)
* [the British Consulate General in Melbourne](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-general-melbourne/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)
* [the British Consulate Perth](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-perth/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

After you’ve requested an appointment the consular officer will contact you to confirm your slot and review dates for your ceremony.

##What documents you’ll need

The consular officer will talk to you about the documents you need when they confirm your appointment to give notice. 

You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

##What you need to do

At your appointment the High Commission or consulate will give you:

- a notice of registration
- a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry

Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the High Commission or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody registers an objection you can get married up to 3 months after you gave notice.

You’ll need to bring two witnesses to your ceremony - they’ll need to show their photo ID (for example passport or driver’s licence).

You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage and a fee for your marriage certificate.

You can’t have a same-sex marriage in a British High Commission or consulate if you’re already in one of these relationships:

* civil partnership (Australian Capital Territory)
* relationship registered under the Relationships Register Act 2010 (New South Wales)
* civil partnership (Queensland)
* significant relationship (Tasmania)
* registered domestic relationship (Victoria)

^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the High Commission or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

## Fees

Service | Fee
-|-
Receiving a notice of registration | £50
Registering a marriage | £150
Issuing a marriage certificate | £50

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Australia](/government/publications/australia-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

##Convert a civil partnership to a same-sex marriage

If you’ve already entered into a civil partnership you may be able to convert it to a same-sex marriage - read [‘Convert a civil partnership to a same-sex marriage abroad’](/convert-civil-partnership-abroad).
